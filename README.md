# Analyzing Bike Sales

This project involves analyzing bike sales data to extract valuable business insights and visualize the results through a Tableau dashboard. The analysis covers various aspects of sales performance, including year-over-year revenue, top and lowest-selling bike models, regional sales distribution, and profit margins.

**Data Preparation**

The dataset was initially processed using Excel to convert the date-time information into a proper date-time object format.

**SQL Analysis**

Used SQL to answer key business questions and gain insights into the sales data. 

**Data Visualization with Tableau**

After extracting insights through SQL, I used Tableau to create an dashboard.

The highest sales volume was observed in North America, with the United States and Canada being the primary contributors. This suggests a strong market presence and customer base in these regions.

Top-Selling Products:

The Road-150 Red, 62 model generated the highest revenue, totaling $3.83 million. This model's popularity indicates a strong customer preference.

Sales by Month:

The monthly revenue analysis reveals that certain months, particularly in Q4, consistently generate higher sales, indicating the impact of seasonal demand.
